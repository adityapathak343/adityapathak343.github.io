    Voyeurism - An Essay

    The term voyeurism comes from a French word called 'voir' which means "to see". Perhaps that is why voyeurism has come to be almost exclusively associated to the visual experience. The American Psychiatric Association in its classification has termed voyeuristic tendencies as a paraphilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) if the person has specifically acted on these urges. The DSM-IV defines voyeurism as the act of looking at "unsuspecting individuals, usually strangers, who are naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity".  But over time, society has accepted a different definition for the term voyeur as a description of anyone who "views" the intimate lives of others, even outside of a sexual context.  This is a reversal from the historical perspective, moving from a term which describes a specific population in detail, to one which describes the general population vaguely.

    "Freud developed his theory of scopophilia further, attaching it initially to pregenital auto-eroticism, after which, by analogy, the pleasure of the look is transferred to other." Scopophilia was further developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of Otto Fenichel. Fenichel was of the view that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'". (Fenichel, Theory, p. 71)
   </p>
   <p>
    This could be the basis for our modern understanding of voyeurism, where a voyeur wants to feel along with the object, or rather, derive one"s own pleasure from the pleasure that the object is feeling. Voyeuristic tendencies have been noticed more commonly in men, and this matches our visual understanding of voyeurism, since men have been discovered to be more responsive to visual, sexual stimulation.
   </p>
   <p>
    "Men generally prefer stimuli that allow objectification of the actor and projection of themselves into the scenario, while women are aroused primarily by stimuli allowing projection, although men also use the projection strategy which is positively associated with sexual arousal. The sex differences observed in subjective sexual arousal to visual sexual stimuli are possibly the combined product of social and biological influences on cognitive processes that direct the perception and assessment of these stimuli.

    The pleasure of looking has often been found to be synonymous to the pleasure of watching cinema. Michael Powel"s film Peeping Tom is basically an exercise to prove to what extent one is capable of watching things he/she shouldn"t watch. Scopophilia was used by cinema psychoanalysts of the 1970s to describe pleasures and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films. Voyeurism and the male gaze have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing, and are most famously discussed in Laura Mulvey's influential 1975 essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema".
   </p>
   <p>
    She writes: "At first glance, the cinema would seem to be remote from the undercover world of the surreptitious observation of an unknowing and unwilling victim. What is seen on screen is so manifestly shown. But the mass of mainstream film and the conventions within which it has consciously evolved, portray a hermetically sealed world which unwinds magically, indifferent to the presence of the audience, producing for them a sense of separation and playing on their voyeuristic fantasy"
   </p>
   <p>
    "In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its fantasy on to the female figure which is stylized accordingly. In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness"

    A Brief Introduction to the Nucleus

    In 1961, the highly acclaimed physicist, Prof. Richard Feynman was asked to take over the introductory course in physics at Caltech, a highly controversial decision at the time, because, although Feynman had proved to be a brilliant physicist, he had shown little to no interest in the field of educating. It was, therefore, highly predictable that his initial lecture was met with high levels of skepticism from the student as well as the scientific community at Caltech. What resulted, however, were a series of some of the best lectures ever delivered in the field of physics. Lectures that captivated the audience, by articulating the most mind-bending concepts of physics in Feynman's own, beautiful language, leading to the creation of the classic, 'The Feynman Lectures on Physics'.

    The structure of an atom, as shown by Rutherford's gold foil experiment, revealed that an atom was mainly free space, with a volume approximately 10-12 times that of an atom. That is a very small number. In context, if the nucleus is the size of the earth, the atom would be the size of 10 solar systems.
   </p>
   <p>
    The remaining free space of the atom consists of atomic shells and subshells. These are defined as the regions where the probability of finding the third subatomic particle, the electron, is high. Electrons contain a negligible mass, about 1/1831 times the mass of a proton or a neutron.
   </p>
   <p>
    The sum of the masses of the protons and the neutrons is defined as the atomic mass of that element.
